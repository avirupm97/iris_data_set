# iris_data_set
 Exploratory data analysis and machine learning on a small inbuilt data set from sklearn, to predict the correctness and identify the
 species of thw flower based on the given rest parameters.
 
 The dataset is inbulit in sklearn. A couple of visualizations were made and then the Support vector machine was implemented.
 
 The description of the columns in the dataset are as follows:
 
 The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

    Iris-setosa (n=50)
    Iris-versicolor (n=50)
    Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:

    sepal length in cm
    sepal width in cm
    petal length in cm
    petal width in cm
    
 Initially no grid Search was applied and the SVM  model was implemented.The efficiency came out to be better than applying the 
 grid search technique because of the small dataset and the there is basically just one point that is too noisey to grab, which 
 makes sense, so model was not overfitted to grab that point.
